# logger

The `logger` directory might not be a standard directory within a NestJS application structure, as logging functionality is typically implemented using middleware or utilities. However, if you're organizing specific logging-related files or functionality separately, you might choose to create a `logger` directory for that purpose.

Inside the `logger` directory, you might have files related to configuring or implementing logging functionality in your application. Here are some examples of what you might find inside the `logger` directory:

- **winston.logger.ts:** A file that defines a logger class or utility functions using the Winston logging library. This file might contain configurations for logging levels, transports (e.g., console, file), and log formatting.

- **custom-logger.ts:** A file that implements custom logging functionality tailored to your application's needs. This file might contain functions or classes for logging specific events, errors, or metrics.

- **logger.middleware.ts:** A file that defines middleware for logging incoming requests and outgoing responses. This file might intercept HTTP requests and responses, log request details, and handle errors.

- **logger.service.ts:** A file that defines a service for logging messages or events throughout your application. This file might provide methods for logging messages at different levels (e.g., info, error, debug) and managing log files or outputs.

- **logger.config.ts:** A file that contains configurations for logging, such as log levels, output formats, log file locations, and other settings related to logging behavior.

- **logger.decorator.ts:** A file that defines decorators for adding logging functionality to specific methods or functions in your application. This file might wrap methods with logging logic to track their execution or capture performance metrics.
