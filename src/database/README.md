# database

Inside the `database` directory, you might have files for different aspects of database management. Here are some examples of what you might find inside the `database` directory:

- **database.module.ts:** A file that defines a NestJS module responsible for configuring and providing database-related services, such as database connections, repositories, or ORM setups. This module might import and configure ORM libraries like TypeORM or Sequelize.

- **database.service.ts:** A file that defines a service responsible for database interaction. This service might encapsulate common database operations, such as querying data, inserting records, updating records, or executing raw SQL queries.

- **models/:** A subdirectory containing files that define database models or entities. These files might contain classes representing database tables, with properties corresponding to table columns and methods for querying or manipulating data.

- **migrations/:** A subdirectory containing database migration files. These files are used to manage changes to the database schema over time, such as creating or modifying tables, columns, or indexes. You might use a database migration tool like TypeORM migrations or Sequelize migrations.

- **seeds/:** A subdirectory containing seed data files. These files are used to populate the database with initial data or test data. You might use seed data to populate lookup tables, create sample records for testing, or initialize the database with default data.

- **config/:** A subdirectory containing database configuration files. These files might specify database connection settings, such as host, port, username, password, database name, or connection pool configurations.
