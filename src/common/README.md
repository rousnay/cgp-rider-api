# shared

The `shared` directory is often used in NestJS applications to contain code or functionality that is shared across multiple modules or components. It serves as a central location for reusable code that doesn't belong to any specific feature or module.

Inside the `shared` directory, you might have various subdirectories or files that encapsulate different types of shared functionality. Here are some examples of what you might find inside the `shared` directory:

- **constants:** A directory containing files that define constants used throughout your application, such as error codes, status codes, or configuration settings.

- **utils:** A directory containing utility functions or classes that provide common functionality needed by multiple parts of your application, such as data validation, date formatting, or encryption.

- **middlewares:** A directory containing middleware functions that can be used by multiple routes or controllers in your application. These middlewares might handle tasks such as authentication, logging, or error handling.

- **interfaces:** A directory containing TypeScript interfaces or types that define the shape of data structures used across your application. These interfaces help ensure type safety and consistency when working with data.

- **services:** A directory containing service classes that encapsulate business logic or functionality shared across different parts of your application. These services might interact with databases, external APIs, or other resources.

- **enums:** A directory containing TypeScript enums that define a set of named constants. These enums can be used to represent a fixed set of values or options within your application.

- **validators:** A directory containing validation functions or classes that validate input data according to predefined rules or schemas. These validators help ensure data integrity and enforce validation rules across your application.

- **helpers:** A directory containing helper functions or classes that provide miscellaneous functionality not covered by other directories. These helpers might assist with tasks such as string manipulation, array manipulation, or error handling.

These are just some examples of what you might organize inside the `shared` directory. The specific structure and contents of the `shared` directory will depend on the needs and architecture of your application.
