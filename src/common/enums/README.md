# enums

Here are some examples of enums that might be placed in an `enums` directory:

- **RoleEnum:** If your application has roles like 'admin', 'user', 'guest', etc., and these roles are used across different modules, you could define a RoleEnum in the `enums` directory.
- **StatusEnum:** If your application has entities with statuses like 'active', 'inactive', 'pending', etc., and these statuses are shared across multiple modules, you could define a StatusEnum in the `enums` directory.
- **ErrorCodeEnum:** If your application has predefined error codes or error types that are used in error handling across different parts of your application, you could define an ErrorCodeEnum in the `enums` directory.
- **PriorityEnum:** If your application deals with tasks or tickets with priorities like 'low', 'medium', 'high', etc., and these priorities are used across different modules, you could define a PriorityEnum in the `enums` directory.
