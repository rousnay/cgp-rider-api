# middleware

Here are some examples of files you might place inside the `middleware` directory:

- **auth.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for authentication. This middleware can verify authentication tokens, session cookies, or API keys and attach user information to the request object for further processing.

- **logger.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for logging incoming requests and outgoing responses. This middleware can log request details such as method, URL, headers, and response details such as status code and response time.

- **validation.middleware.ts:** A middleware that validates incoming request data against predefined rules or schemas, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

- **compression.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for compressing response data to reduce network bandwidth usage. This middleware can compress response bodies using gzip or deflate compression algorithms.

- **error-handler.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for handling errors that occur during request processing. This middleware can catch errors, log them, and send an appropriate error response to the client.

- **cors.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. This middleware can add CORS headers to responses to allow or restrict access from different origins.

- **csrf.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This middleware can generate and validate CSRF tokens to ensure that requests originate from trusted sources.

- **rate-limit.middleware.ts:** Middleware responsible for rate limiting incoming requests. This middleware can restrict the number of requests a client can make within a certain time period to prevent abuse or overload of the server.
