# pipes

Here are some examples of files you might place inside the `pipes` directory:

- **validation.pipe.ts:** A pipe that performs validation on incoming data based on predefined rules or schemas. This pipe ensures that incoming requests meet certain criteria before being processed further.

- **transform.pipe.ts:** A pipe that transforms incoming data into a different format or structure. This pipe can be used to normalize or sanitize input data before it's processed by route handlers or controllers.

- **sanitize.pipe.ts:** A pipe that sanitizes incoming data by removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters or values. This pipe helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.

- **format.pipe.ts:** A pipe that formats incoming data according to specified rules or templates. This pipe can be used to enforce consistency in data formatting across your application.

- **cache.pipe.ts:** A pipe that implements caching functionality for certain requests or responses. This pipe can cache the results of expensive operations to improve performance and reduce load on backend systems.

- **rate-limit.pipe.ts:** A pipe that enforces rate-limiting rules for incoming requests. This pipe can restrict the number of requests a client can make within a certain time period to prevent abuse or overload of your server.
